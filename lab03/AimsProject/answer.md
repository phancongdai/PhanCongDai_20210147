# Advantages of Polymorphism:

- Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that can work with objects of different classes that share a common interface or base class. This reduces code duplication and makes your code more maintainable.

- Flexibility: Polymorphism enables you to design applications that can adapt to different situations without modifying the core logic. You can define different implementations of the same behavior for different types of objects, making your code more flexible and responsive.

- Dynamic Binding: At runtime, the appropriate method is determined based on the actual object's type. This allows for a more dynamic and adaptable programming style.

- Improved Readability: Polymorphism can make code easier to read and understand, as you focus on what needs to be done rather than the specific implementation details for each type of object.

# How Inheritance is Used for Polymorphism:

- Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows you to create new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behavior from existing classes (superclasses).

- When a subclass overrides a method inherited from the superclass, it provides its own implementation of that method. This is a key mechanism for achieving polymorphism.

- In Java, when you have a collection of objects of various subclasses that are all derived from a common superclass (or implement a common interface), and you call a method on that collection, polymorphism kicks in. The actual method implementation invoked will depend on the specific type of object at runtime.

# Differences Between Polymorphism and Inheritance:

## Concept:

- Polymorphism: The ability of objects to respond differently to the same method call.
Inheritance: A mechanism for creating new classes (subclasses) that inherit properties and behavior from existing classes (superclasses).
Relationship:

- Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance, but it's not limited to it. Polymorphism can also be achieved with interfaces and abstract classes.
Inheritance is a broader concept that establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.
Focus:

- Polymorphism focuses on how objects behave at runtime.
Inheritance focuses on how classes are structured and how they share properties and methods.
In essence, polymorphism is a powerful tool that leverages inheritance and other object-oriented concepts to create flexible, reusable, and adaptable code in Java.

1. Class Implementing Comparable:

The class that should implement the Comparable interface depends on your data structure for cart items. In most cases, it would be the class representing the items themselves. This could be a CartItem, Product, or a similar class that encapsulates the item's data.
2. Implementing compareTo() for Ordering:

The compareTo(Object) method in Comparable takes a single argument of the same type and returns an integer based on the comparison:
0 indicates equal objects.
A positive value (> 0) signifies the current object is "greater than" the argument.
A negative value (< 0) indicates the current object is "less than" the argument.
To implement the desired ordering, consider the relevant attributes of your items. Here are common scenarios:


3. Multiple Ordering Rules with Comparable:

The Comparable interface enforces a single natural ordering for a class. If you need different ordering rules, here are two approaches:

Create Separate Classes:
If the different ordering rules are fundamentally distinct, consider creating separate classes that inherit from a common base class. Each subclass can implement Comparable and define its compareTo() method for its specific ordering criteria.

Use a Comparator:
For more flexibility, you can create a custom Comparator class that implements the Comparator<CartItem> interface. This Comparator can take two CartItem objects and compare them based on the desired criteria (e.g., title then cost). You can then use this Comparator with sorting methods like Collections.sort().

4. Special Ordering for DVDs:

If DVDs have a unique ordering rule (title, then decreasing length, then cost), you can create a separate subclass of CartItem or Product specifically for DVDs. This subclass would implement Comparable and define its compareTo() method to reflect the DVD-specific ordering logic.
Example (Assuming DVD is a subclass of CartItem):

Java
public class DVD extends CartItem implements Comparable<DVD> {

    private int length;

    // ... other DVD attributes

    @Override
    public int compareTo(DVD other) {
        int titleComparison = getTitle().compareTo(other.getTitle());
        if (titleComparison != 0) {
            return titleComparison;
        } else {
            int lengthComparison = Integer.compare(length, other.length);
            if (lengthComparison != 0) {
                return -lengthComparison; // Descending order for length
            } else {
                return Double.compare(getCost(), other.getCost());
            }
        }
    }
}

By following these guidelines and leveraging Comparator when necessary, you can effectively implement different ordering rules for your cart items using the Comparable interface or alternative approaches.
